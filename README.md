# 🧠 Logistic Regression – Hyperparameter Tuning 
## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates hyperparameter tuning of a Logistic Regression model using the Breast Cancer dataset for better classification performance.

The goal is to understand how different hyperparameters impact model accuracy and generalization.

## 📂 Dataset

Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Task: Binary Classification (Malignant vs Benign)

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

Checked and handled missing values

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Train-Test Split

## 🔍 Model Used

Logistic Regression

🎯 Hyperparameters Tuned

The following parameters were tuned:

C → Regularization strength

penalty → L1 / L2

solver → liblinear / saga

max_iter

Used:

GridSearchCV

RandomizedSearchCV 

# 🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Pandas


## 🚀 Learning Outcome
